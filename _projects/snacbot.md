SNACBot is a 5-axis robot arm that autonomously feeds people snacks. It uses a gripper-mounted Intel RealSense depth camera and computer vision/machine learning techniques to find, grasp, and deliver food to a human.

The arm is entirely 3D printed and utilizes Dynamixel servo motors for each joint. It uses ROS Noetic and the MoveIt framework controlling the arm. Food detection was done using the YOLOv5 framework. You can find more info in the repository, report, and video presentation linked at the bottom. The overall architecture of the system is shown in the image below
