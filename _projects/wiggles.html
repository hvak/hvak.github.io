excerpt: "**Relevant skills: Embedded Systems, MicroPython, Soft Robotics, 3D-Printing**
A soft robotic crawler that utilizes kresling origami, soft C-springs, and motor-driven cables for earthworm-style
locomotion. The design was modeled after the guidlines for the RoboSoft 2023 pipeline crawling competition."

<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<p>
    Soft robots have been gaining popularity in recent years due to their ability to adapt to complex environments and
    tasks. Additionally, soft robots have emerged as a promising solution for navigating through confined spaces, such
    as pipes. In this paper, we present a cable-driven soft robot capable of autonomous pipeline traversal using
    earthworm-style locomotion. The robot is comprised of a body made of Kresling geometry, as well as two end-pieces
    that contain soft C-springs. The body and C-springs are compressed with cables actuated by high-torque motors. This
    robot was designed to compete in tasks that emulate the 2023 RoboSoft competition, in which a soft robot is required
    to traverse pipes in various configurations. Our results from testing show the robot is able to successfully move
    along straight paths at any incline but struggled moving through turns. However, we believe that, with improvements,
    this design can be very effective for autonomous pipeline navigation and has high potential to be untethered.
