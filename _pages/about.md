Hi, I'm Hersh Vakharia — a Software Engineer at Microsoft in the Surface org.

I earned my Master's degree in Robotics from the University of Michigan (go blue) in 2024, where I researched perception, sensor fusion, and explainable AI. Before that, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with a minor in mathematics, also at the University of Michigan.

On the technical side, I'm most interested in embedded systems, robot perception & sensing, and robot control systems. On the non-technical side, I enjoy photography ([@hersh.takes.pictures](https://www.instagram.com/hersh.takes.pictures/)), hiking, and tennis.

On this website, you can check out my publications, projects, as well as my resume.
