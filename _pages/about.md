Hi, I'm Hersh Vakharia — a Software Engineer at Microsoft in the Surface org.

I earned my Master's degree in Robotics from the University of Michigan, where I researched perception, sensing, and explainable AI. Before that, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with a minor in mathematics, also at the university of Michigan.
